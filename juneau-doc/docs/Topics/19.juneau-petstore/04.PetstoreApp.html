About Petstore App <br>

        What is the Petstore app?
    </h3>
    <p>

        Petstore is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) application,
        which is meant to demonstrate the advantages of the Apache Juneau library.
        It is a live example showing how any JAVA back-end developer can use Juneau for parsing,
        POJO serialization and sending different types of serialized POJOs over REST.

    </p>
    <h3>What's the project layout?</h3>
    <p> Petstore application consists of three main parts, which are connected over REST:
        <ul>
            <li>Database: Apache Derby.</li>
            <li>Server: Java Spring Boot. </li>
            <li>Client: Java Spring Boot or React.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p> Java back-end and front-end runs on: http://localhost:5000;
        <br>React front-end runs on: http://localhost:3000.
    </p>

    <p> Project is based on a standard Spring Boot project structure. There are Models, Repositories, Services.
        <br>The main difference here - no Controller classes or @RestController annotations.
        Instead of it, we use PetStore.java interface class where REST calls are mapped with different methods.
    </p>
    <p>Petstore has three types of DTO objects (database entities): Pets, Orders and Users. </p>
    <p>All methods for creating, reading, updating or deleting database entities (pets, orders or users) are provided in
        PetStoreService.java class. </p>
    <p> Example Pet, Order and User objects are created at program
        startup and saved in the database using JPA (Java Persistence API) and PetStoreService methods.</p>

    <h3>How does it work ?</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>

            <li>To get the data which should be displayed, Petstore app client
                sends http request GET to the back-end server. The response data goes
                over the REST connection where POJOs get serialized.
                Petstore client can get and display different types of the same POJO:
                simple (standard) json format and other (not standard) formats.

            <li>Response data (array of objects) in standard JSON format here is used to generate table content
                (for example, all Pets in Store).</li>

            <li>Other types of these objects are displayed in the page section "Content types".
                Here you can get the same POJOs displayed in different formats: json simple, json schema,
                www form urlencoded, octal/msg, html, html schema, html stripped, openapi, plain text, uon, xml, xml
                schema, xml soap.
            </li>
            <li>All readable table content and visual representation of the different content types are generated from
                the response data.</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
