{title:'HTTP Parts', created:'9.0.0'}

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		The {@link oaj.http} package contains a slew of useful extensions to the Apache HttpComponents libraries
		and define APIs used extensively in the REST server and client APIs.
	</p>
	<ul class='javatree'>
		<li class='jp'>{@link oaj.http} - Utility classes used for HTTP parts/headers/entities.
		<li class='jp'>{@link oaj.http.annotation} - Swagger-based annotations used on both server-side APIs and client-side proxy interfaces.
		<li class='jp'>{@link oaj.http.entity} - HTTP entity classes.
		<li class='jp'>{@link oaj.http.header} - HTTP header classes.
		<li class='jp'>{@link oaj.http.part} - HTTP query/form-data/path classes.
		<li class='jp'>{@link oaj.http.remote} - Remote proxy interface API
		<li class='jp'>{@link oaj.http.resource} - HTTP resource classes.
		<li class='jp'>{@link oaj.http.response} - HTTP response classes.
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		These APIs extend from the Apache HttpComponents libraries and can be used with libraries based on it such
		as Apache HttpClient.  The REST Client API described later is built on top of Apache HttpClient and many
		of the classes defined in this package make up integral components of that API.  Likewise, the APIs
		defined here are also used in the REST Server APIs also described later.
