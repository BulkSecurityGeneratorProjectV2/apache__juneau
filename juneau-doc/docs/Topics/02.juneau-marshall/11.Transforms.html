Transforms

<p>
	By default, the Juneau framework can serialize and parse a wide variety of POJOs out-of-the-box.  
	However, two special classes are provided tailor how certain Java objects are handled by the framework.
	These classes are:
</p>
<ul class='doctree'>
	<li class='jc'>{@link oaj.transform.BeanFilter} - Transforms that alter the way beans are handled.
	<li class='jac'>{@link oaj.transform.PojoSwap} - Transforms that swap non-serializable POJOs with 
		serializable POJOs during serialization (and optionally vis-versa during parsing).
		<ul>
			<li class='jc'>{@link oaj.transform.StringSwap} - Convenience subclass for swaps that convert 
				objects to strings.
			<li class='jc'>{@link oaj.transform.MapSwap} - Convenience subclass for swaps that convert 
				objects to maps.
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Transforms are added to serializers and parsers (and REST clients) using the following configuration properties:
</p> 
<ul class='doctree'>
	<li class='jc'>{@link oaj.BeanContext}
	<ul>
		<li class='jf'>{@link oaj.BeanContext#BEAN_beanFilters BEAN_beanFilters}
		<li class='jf'>{@link oaj.BeanContext#BEAN_pojoSwaps BEAN_pojoSwaps}
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	Annotations are also provided for specifying transforms directly on classes and methods (all described in later sections):
</p>
<ul class='doctree'>
	<li class='ja'>
		{@link oaj.annotation.Swap} 
		- Used to tailor how non-bean POJOs get interpreted by the framework.
	<li class='ja'>
		{@link oaj.annotation.Bean} 
		- Used to tailor how beans get interpreted by the framework.
	<li class='ja'>
		{@link oaj.annotation.BeanConstructor} 
		- Maps constructor arguments to property names on beans with read-only properties.
	<li class='ja'>
		{@link oaj.annotation.BeanIgnore} 
		- Ignore classes, fields, and methods from being interpreted as bean or bean components.
	<li class='ja'>
		{@link oaj.annotation.BeanProperty} 
		- Used to tailor how bean properties get interpreted by the framework.
	<li class='ja'>
		{@link oaj.annotation.NameProperty} 
		- Identifies a setter as a method for setting the name of a POJO as it's known by its parent object.
	<li class='ja'>
		{@link oaj.annotation.ParentProperty} 
		- Identifies a setter as a method for adding a parent reference to a child object.
	<li class='ja'>
		{@link oaj.annotation.URI} 
		- Used to identify a class or bean property as a URI.
</ul>
