Juneau JAX-RS Provider

<p>
	The Juneau framework contains the <l>juneau-rest-server-jaxrs</l> bundle for performing simple
	integration of Juneau serializers and parsers in JAX-RS compliant environments.
</p>
<p>
	It should be noted that although some of the functionality of the Juneau Server API is provided through the JAX-RS 
	integration components, it is not nearly as flexible as using the {@link oajr.RestServlet} class directly.
</p>
<p>
	What you can do with the Juneau JAX-RS provider classes:
</p>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>
		Use existing Juneau serializers and parsers for converting streams to POJOs and vis-versa.
	<li>
		Use annotations to specify filters and properties using the {@link oajr.annotation.RestOp @RestOp}
		and {@link oajr.jaxrs.JuneauProvider} annotations.
</ul>
<p>
	What you can't do with the Juneau JAX-RS provider classes:
</p>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>
		Specify or override serializers/parsers at the Java class and method levels.
		<br>JAX-RS does not provide the capability to use different providers for the same media types
		at the class or method levels. 
	<li>
		Specify or override filters and properties at the Java class level.
	<li>
		Default stylesheets for the {@link oaj.html.HtmlDocSerializer} class.
		<br>It will produce HTML, but it won't contain any styles applied.
	<li>
		The ability to specify HTTP method, headers, and content using GET parameters.
		<br>These make debugging REST interfaces using only a browser possible.
	<li>
		Class or method level encoding.
	<li>
		Class or method level guards.
	<li>
		Class or method level converters.
</ul>

<p>
	The Juneau JAX-RS provider API consists of the following classes:
</p>
<ul class='javatree'>
	<li class='jc'>
		{@link oajr.jaxrs.BaseProvider} - The base provider class that implements the JAX-RS 
		<c>MessageBodyReader</c> and <c>MessageBodyWriter</c> interfaces.
	<li class='jc'>
		{@link oajr.jaxrs.JuneauProvider} - Annotation that is applied to subclasses of <c>BaseProvider</c>
		to specify the serializers/parsers associated with a provider, and optionally filters and properties to 
		apply to those serializers and parsers.
	<li class='jc'>
		{@link oajr.jaxrs.BasicProvider} - A default provider that provides the same level
		of media type support as the {@link oajr.BasicRestServlet} class.
</ul>
<p>
	For the most part, when using these components, you'll either use the existing <l>BasicProvider</l>, 
	or define your own by subclassing <l>BaseProvider</l>.
</p>
