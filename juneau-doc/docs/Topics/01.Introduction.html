<h5 class='topic'>History</h5>
<p>
	Juneau started off as a popular internal IBM toolkit called Juno.
	Originally used for serializing POJOs to and from JSON, it later expanded in scope to include a variety of 
	content types, and then later REST servlet, client, and microservice APIs.
	It's use grew to more than 50 projects and was one of the most popular community source projects within IBM.
</p>
<p>
	In June of 2016, the code was donated to the Apache Foundation under the project <l>Apache Juneau</l> where it 
	has continued to evolve to where it is today.
