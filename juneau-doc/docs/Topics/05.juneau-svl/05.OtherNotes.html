Other Notes

<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>
		The escape character <js>'\'</js> can be used when necessary to escape the following characters: 
		<code>$ , { }</code>
	<li>
		<b>WARNING:</b>  It is possible to cause {@link java.lang.StackOverflowError StackOverflowErrors} if 
		your nested variables result in a recursive loop (e.g. the environment variable 
		<code>'MYPROPERTY'</code> has the value <code>'$E{MYPROPERTY}'</code>).
		So don't do that!
	<li>
		As a general rule, this class tries to be as efficient as possible by not creating new strings when not 
		needed.
		<br>For example, calling the resolve method on a string that doesn't contain variables (e.g. 
		<code>resolver.resolve(<js>"foobar"</js>)</code>) will simply be a no-op and return the same string.
</ul>
