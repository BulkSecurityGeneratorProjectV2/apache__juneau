Logging

<p>
	Use the {@link oajrc.RestClientBuilder#logTo(Level,Logger)} and 
	{@link oajrc.RestCall#logTo(Level,Logger)} methods to log HTTP calls.
	These methods will cause the HTTP request and response headers and body to be logged to the specified logger.  
</p>

<h5 class='figure'>Example:</h5>
<p class='bpcode w800'>
	<jc>// Log the HTTP request/response to the specified logger.</jc>
	<jk>int</jk> rc = restClient.doGet(<jsf>URL</jsf>).logTo(<jsf>INFO</jsf>, getLogger()).run();
</p>
<p>
	The method call is ignored if the logger level is below the specified level.
</p>
<p>
	Customized logging can be handled by sub-classing the {@link oajrc.RestCallLogger} 
	class and using the  {@link oajrc.RestCall#interceptor(RestCallInterceptor)} method.
</p>
