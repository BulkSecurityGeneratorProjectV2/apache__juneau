Resource Resolvers

<p>
	By default, you can add the {@link oajr.annotation.RestResource @RestResource}
	to any class as long as it has one of the following constructors:
</p>
<ul>
	<li class='jm'><code><jk>public</jk> T()</code>
	<li class='jm'><code><jk>public</jk> T(RestContextBuilder)</code>
</ul>
<p>
	The latter constructor can be used to get access to the {@link oajr.RestContextBuilder} object to make
	any configurations to the resource before it's initialized.
</p>
<p>
	Resource object resolution is controlled through the following API:
</p>
<ul class='doctree'>
	<li class='jic'>{@link oajr.RestResourceResolver}
	<ul>
		<li class='jc'>{@link oajr.BasicRestResourceResolver}
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	This API can be extended to provide your own custom resource resolution.
	Later topics discuss how to use this API to instantiate resources using Spring.
