Children

<p>
	Child Resources are REST servlets or objects that are linked to parent resources through the 
	{@link oajr.annotation.RestResource#children() @RestResource(children)} annotation.
</p>
<h5 class='figure'>Example:</h5>
<p class='bpcode w800'>
	<jd>/** Parent Resource */</jd>
	<ja>@RestResource</ja>(
		path=<js>"/parent"</js>,
		children={FooResource.<jk>class</jk>}
	)
	<jk>public</jk> MyResource <jk>extends</jk> BasicRestServlet {...}
</p>
<p class='bpcode w800'>
	<jd>/** Child Resource */</jd>
 	<ja>@RestResource</ja>(
		path=<js>"/foo"</js>  <jc>// Path relative to parent resource.</jc>
	)
	<jk>public</jk> FooResource {...} <jc>// Note that we don't need to extend from RestServlet.</jc>
</p>
<p>
	The path of the child resource gets appended to the path of the parent resource. 
	So in the example above, the child resource is accessed through the URL <l>/parent/foo</l>.
</p>
<p>
	A HUGE advantage of using child resources is that they do not need to be declared in the JEE <l>web.xml</l> 
	file.
	Initialization of and access to the child resources occurs through the parent resource.
	Children can be nested arbitrary deep to create complex REST interfaces with a single top-level REST servlet.
