ReaderResource

<p>
	The {@link oaj.http.ReaderResource} class is a convenience object for defining thread-safe
	reusable character-based responses.
	In essence, it's a container for character data with optional response headers and support for
	resolving SVL variables.
</p>

<p>
	The class is annotated with {@link oaj.http.annotation.Response @Response}
	which allows it to be returned as responses by REST methods.
</p>
<h5 class='figure'>Example:</h5>
<p class='bpcode w800'>
	<ja>@RestMethod</ja>
	<jk>public</jk> Object sayHello(RestRequest req) {
	
		<jc>// Return a reader resource loaded from a file with support for request-time SVL variables.</jc>
		<jk>return</jk> ReaderResource.<jsm>create</jsm>()
			.contents(<jk>new</jk> File(<js>"helloWorld.txt"</js>))
			.varResolver(req.getVarResolver()) 
			.header(<js>"Cache-Control"</js>, <js>"no-cache"</js>)
			.mediaType(<jsf>TEXT_PLAIN</jsf>)
			.build();
	}
