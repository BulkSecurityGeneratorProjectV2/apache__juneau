Annotation Inheritance

<p>
	The {@link oajr.annotation.RestResource @RestResource} annotation can also be used on parents and interfaces of resource classes.
	When multiple annotations are defined at different levels, the annotation values are combined.
</p>
<p>
	This is a particularly useful feature because it allows you to define your own configured parent
	resource classes that can be extended by all your child resources so that they all share common
	settings.
