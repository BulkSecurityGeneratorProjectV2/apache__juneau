{8.1.0-new} 
BasicRestGroup

<p>
	The {@link oajr.BasicRestGroup} class is identical to the {@link oajr.BasicRestServletGroup} class except that
	it does not extend from <c>HttpServlet</c>.
	It defines the exact same set of serializers, parsers, etc., but it cannot be deployed as a top-level
	servlet.  It can however be used for child resources registered via the {@link oajr.annotation.Rest#children() @Rest(children)} 
	annotation.
