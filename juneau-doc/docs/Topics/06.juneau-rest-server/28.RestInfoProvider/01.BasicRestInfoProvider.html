BasicRestInfoProvider

<p>
	The {@link oajr.BasicRestInfoProvider} class is the default implementation of the
	{@link oajr.RestInfoProvider} interface.
</p>
<p>
	It finds and collects information gathered from the following locations:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Localized JSON Swagger files in the classpath.
	<li>Reflection.
	<li>Annotations.
	<li>Properties files.
</ul>
<p>
	The class itself is designed to be extended if you wish to rely mostly on the default behavior, but tweak
	certain aspects.
</p>
