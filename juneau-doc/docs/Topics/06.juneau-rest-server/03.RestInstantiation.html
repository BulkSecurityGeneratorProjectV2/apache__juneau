<p>
	REST resources are deployed in one of two ways:
</p>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>Deployed in a J2EE container as a servlet.
	<li>Deployed as a child of another REST resource.
</ul>
<p>
	When deployed in a J2EE container, you MUST extend from one of the servlet classes.
</p>
<p>
	<b>When deployed as a child of another resource, you MAY extend from one of the servlet classes but it's 
	not necessary.</b>
	The only requirement is that the class be annotated with <ja>@Rest</ja> and have one of the following constructors:
</p>
<ul class='javatree'>
	<li class='jm'><c><jk>public</jk> T()</c>
	<li class='jm'><c><jk>public</jk> T(RestContext.Builder)</c>
</ul>
<p>
	And even that requirement is relaxed if you implement your own REST resource resolver (described later).
</p>
<p>
	For example:
</p>
<p class='bpcode w800'>
	<jc>// Top level resource is deployed like any other servlet and must subclass from RestServlet.</jc>
	<ja>@Rest</ja>(
		path=<js>"/top"</js>,
		children={
			ChildResource.<jk>class</jk>  <jc>// Accessed via URI "/top/child"</jc>
		}
	)
	<jk>public class</jk> TopLevelResource <jk>extends</jk> BasicRestServlet {...}
</p>
<p class='bpcode w800'>
	<jc>// Child resources can inherit from RestServlet but it's not a requirement.</jc>
	<ja>@Rest</ja>(
		path=<js>"/child"</js>
	)
	<jk>public class</jk> ChildResource <jk>extends</jk> WhateverYouWant {...}
</p>		
<p>
	That's all there is to it!
	There's no code scanning, module configuration/initialization classes, or anything complex like that.
	It's just a servlet.
</p>
