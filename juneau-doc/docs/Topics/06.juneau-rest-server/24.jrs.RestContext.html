{title:'RestContext', flags:'todo'}

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		The {@link oajr.RestContext} object is the workhorse class for all of the configuration
		of a single REST resource class.
		It's by-far the most important class in the REST API.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every class annotated with <l>@Rest</l> ends up with an instance of this object.
		The object itself is read-only and unchangeable.
		It is populated through the following:
	</p>
	<ul class='javatree'>
		<li class='ja'>{@link oajr.annotation.Rest} - Settings copied from the annotation during servlet initialization.
		<li class='jm'>{@link oajr.RestContext.Builder} - Builder used during servlet initialization.
	</ul>
	<p>
		The annotation should be self-explanatory at this point.
		The builder allows you to perform all of the same configuration as the annotation programmatically.
	</p>
	<p>
		The {@link oajr.RestContext.Builder} class extends {@link oaj.BeanContext.Builder}
		allowing you to programmatically set any properties defined on that builder class.
		It also implements {@link javax.servlet.ServletConfig}
	</p>
	<p>
		To access this object, simply pass it in as a constructor argument or in an INIT hook:
	</p>
	<p class='bjava'>
		|	<jc>// Option #1 - Pass in through constructor.</jc>
		|	<jk>public</jk> MyResource(RestContext.Builder builder) {
		|			builder
		|				.swaps(TemporalCalendarSwap.Rfc1123DateTime.<jk>class</jk>)
		|				.set(<jsf>PARSER_debug</jsf>);
		|	}
		|
		|	<jc>// Option #2 - Use an INIT hook.</jc>
		|	<ja>@RestHook</ja>(<jsf>INIT</jsf>)
		|	<jk>public void</jk> init(RestContext.Builder builder) <jk>throws</jk> Exception {
		|			builder
		|				.swaps(TemporalCalendarSwap.Rfc1123DateTime.<jk>class</jk>)
		|				.set(<jsf>PARSER_debug</jsf>);
		|	}
	</p>
	<p>
		Warning:  The builder class is huge.
		Through it, you can configure bean/serializer/parser settings, define config files, children, 
			resource finders, info providers, etc...
	</p>
