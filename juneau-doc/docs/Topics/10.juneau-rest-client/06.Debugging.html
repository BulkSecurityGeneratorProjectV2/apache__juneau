Debugging

<p>
	Use the {@link oajrc.RestClientBuilder#debug()} method to enable logging for HTTP requests
	made from the client.
</p>
<p>
	Under-the-covers, this is simply a shortcut for adding the {@link oajrc.RestCallLogger#DEFAULT} 
	interceptor to the client.  
	This causes the following output to be generated by the Java <c>org.apache.juneau.rest.client</c> 
	logger at <jsf>WARNING</jsf> level:
</p>
<p class='bpcode w800 console'>
	=== HTTP Call (outgoing) =======================================================
	=== REQUEST ===
	POST http://localhost:10000/testUrl HTTP/1.1
	---request headers---
		Debug: true
		No-Trace: true
		Accept: application/json
	---request entity---
		Content-Type: application/json
	---request content---
	{"foo":"bar","baz":123}
	=== RESPONSE ===
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	---response headers---
		Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
		Content-Length: 21
		Server: Jetty(8.1.0.v20120127)
	---response content---
	{"message":"OK then"}
	=== END ========================================================================
</p>
<p>
	This setting also causes a <c>Debug: true</c> header value to trigger logging of the request on the 
	server side as well.
</p>
