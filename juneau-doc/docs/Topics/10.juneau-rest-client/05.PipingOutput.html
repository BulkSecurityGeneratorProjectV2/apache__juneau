Piping Response Output

<p>
	The {@link oajrc.RestCall} class provides various convenience <c>pipeTo()</c> 
	methods to pipe output to output streams and writers.
</p>
<p>
	If you want to pipe output without any intermediate buffering, you can use the 
	{@link oajrc.RestCall#byLines()} method.  
	This will cause the output to be piped and flushed after every line.  
	This can be useful if you want to display the results in real-time from a long running process producing
	output on a REST call.
</p>

<h5 class='figure'>Example:</h5>
<p class='bpcode w800'>
	<jc>// Pipe output from REST call to System.out in real-time.</jc>
	restClient.doPost(<jsf>URL</jsf>).byLines().pipeTo(<jk>new</jk> PrintWriter(System.<jk>out</jk>)).run();
</p>
