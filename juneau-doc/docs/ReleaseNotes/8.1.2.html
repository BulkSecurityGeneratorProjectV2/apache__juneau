8.1.2 (TBD)

<p>
	Juneau 8.1.2 is ...
</p>

<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-marshall</h5>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>
		New convenience methods:
		<ul>	
			<li class='jm'>{@link oaj.ObjectMap.parse(String)}
			<li class='jm'>{@link oaj.ObjectList.parse(String)}
		</ul>
	<li>
		{@link oaj.marshall.CharMarshall} and {@link oaj.marshall.StreamMarshall} now have public constructors.
	<li>
		{@link oaj.annotation.Beanp @Beanp} replaces {@link oaj.annotation.BeanProperty @BeanProperty} with shorter syntax.
</ul>

<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-rest-server</h5>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>
		New method {@link oajr.RestResponse.setHeaderSafe(String,String)} to strip invalid characters from header values.
	<li>
		Fixed issues related to invalid characters being set on HTTP header values.
</ul>

<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-rest-client</h5>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>
		{@link oajr.RestClient} is now extendible.  The constructor has been made public and simplified to:
		{@link oajr.RestClient(RestClientBuilder)}.
	<li>
		Duplicate methods between {@link oajr.RestClientBuilder} and {@link org.apache.http.impl.client.HttpClientBuilder}
		have been made deprecated on the former.  This eliminates the need to try to keep the two builder classes in
		sync.
</ul>
