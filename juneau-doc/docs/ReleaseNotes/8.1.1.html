8.1.1 (TBD)

<p>
	TODO
</p>

<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-marshall</h5>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>
		Support for serializing/parsing {@link java.util.Optional} objects and bean properties.
	<li>
		Fixed a bug in the parsers where the generic subtype of a complex bean property type involving both collections and arrays
		was not being found.  (e.g. <c>List&lt;Long&gt;[]</c>)
	<li>
		New packages of HTTP response/exceptions beans moved from <c>juneau-rest-server</c> bundle so that they can be 
		used when building REST proxy interfaces without having to pull in the server bundle.
		<ul>
			<li class='jp'>{@link oaj.http.response}
			<li class='jp'>{@link oaj.http.exception}
		</ul>
		These replace the <c>org.apache.juneau.rest.response</c> and <c>org.apache.juneau.rest.exception</c> packages.
</ul>

<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-rest-server</h5>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>
		Support for {@link Optional} on method parameters annotated with {@link oaj.http.annotation.Header}, {@link oaj.http.annotation.FormData},  
		{@link oaj.http.annotation.Query}, {@link oaj.http.annotation.Path}, and {@link oaj.http.annotation.PathRemainder}.
	<li>
		Fixed issue where {@link oajr.annotation.RestRequest#debug() RestRequest.debug()} annotation wasn't resulting
		in the HTTP request being logged.
	<li>
		{@link oajr.RestException} has been deprecated and replaced by {@link oaj.http.exception.HttpException}.
	<li>
		Resolved issue where parameterized types on <ja>@RestMethod</ja>-annotated method parameters of Spring beans.
		This is due to Spring relying on CGLIB for runtime-recompilation of beans that results in loss of parameterized-type
		information.  
		<br>In the following example, the <c>beans</c> parameter would resolve as an unparameterized <c>List</c>
		which would typically result in getting a <c>List&lt;ObjectMap&gt;<c> and subsequent <c>ClassCastExceptions</c>.   
		<p class='bpcode w800'>
	<ja>@RestMethod</ja>
	<jk>public void</jk> doFoo(<ja>@Body</ja> List&lt;MyBean&gt; beans) {...}
		</p>
		The fix involves resolving the original bean class for resolving parameterized type while leaving
		method invocation on the proxy method so as not to bypass Spring features.
</ul>

<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-rest-client</h5>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>
		Removed the dependency on the <c>juneau-rest-server</c> module.  
		Allows the client API to be used without pulling in all the javax.servlet and server dependencies.
</ul>
