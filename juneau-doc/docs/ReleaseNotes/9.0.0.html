9.0.0 (TBD)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juneau 9.0.0 is a major release.  Deprecated APIs that have been accumulating over time have been removed.
		The underlying code has undergone significant refactoring to ease maintainability and improve overall performance.
	</p>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>General changes</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			Configuration properties have been removed entirely.  They have been replaced with a standard builder-based
			architecture.  In addition to making the code more maintainable, it also improves performance when
			creating new serializers/parsers/rest clients (and others).
	</ul>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-marshall</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			Eliminated the various <c><ja>@XConfig</ja>(applyX={...})</c> annotations and replaced them with the ability
			to apply targeted annotations directly to configuration classes and methods (such as REST classes/methods).
			<p class='bcode'>
				|	<ja>@Rest</ja>(...)
				|	<ja>@Bean</ja>(on=<js>"MyBean1,MyBean2"</js>,sort=<jk>true</jk>)
				|	<ja>@UrlEncoding</ja>(onClass=MyList.<jk>class</jk>,expandedParams=<jk>true</jk>)
				|	<jk>public class</jk> MyRestClass {
				|		
				|		<ja>@RestOp</ja>(...)
				|		<ja>@Bean</ja>(on=<js>"MyBean1,MyBean2"</js>,sort=<jk>false</jk>)
				|		<ja>@UrlEncoding</ja>(onClass=MyList.<jk>class</jk>,expandedParams=<jk>false</jk>)
				|		<jk>public</jk> Object myRestMethod() { ... }
				|	}
			</p>
		<li>
			New shortened form {@link oaj.http.remote.RemoteOp#value()} for specifying http method name and path.
			<p class='bcode'>
				|	<jc>// Normal form</jc>
				|	<ja>@RemoteOp</ja>(method=<jsf>PUT</jsf>, path=<js>"/foo"</js>)
				|	
				|	<jc>// Shortened form</jc>
				|	<ja>@RemoteOp</ja>(<js>"PUT /foo"</js>)
			</p>
		<li>
			New annotations:  {@link oaj.http.remote.RemoteGet}/{@link oaj.http.remote.RemotePut}/{@link oaj.http.remote.RemotePost}/{@link oaj.http.remote.RemoteDelete}
		<li>
			Significant refactoring of the classes in the {@link oaj.http} package and subpackages.  Attempts were made to make classes as natural
			extensions to the Apache HttpComponents APIs.  Significant new functionality here.
		<li>
			New {@link oaj.annotation.Marshalled @Marshalled} annotation for non-bean classes.
		<li>
			New {@link oaj.annotation.Bean#example() @Bean(example)} annotation.
		<li>
			New {@link oaj.annotation.BeanConfig#ignoreUnknownEnumValues() @BeanConfig(ignoreUnknownEnumValues)} annotation and support for ignoring
			unknown enum values during parsing.
		<li>
			Java Serialized Object marshalling support has been removed entirely due to security risks with usage (better safe than sorry).
	</ul>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-rest-server</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			Significant refactoring done to allow for many extensible aspects of the API to be performed through injected beans
			in Spring.  These include logging, debugging, REST method arg types, static files, file finders, swagger creators, thrown stores, response
			processors, serializers/parsers, JSON schema generators, statistics gathering stores, and default request attributes/headers and response
			headers.
		<li>
			Defining REST resources with predefined marshalling support is now much simpler.  You now extend from a basic REST servlet/object
			class and then include an interface with predefined common annotations.
			<p class='bcode'>
				|	<jc>// A root resource that supports JSON/HTML marshalling.</jc>
				|	<jk>public class</jk> MyRootResources <jk>extends</jk> BasicRestServletGroup <jk>implements</jk> BasicJsonHtmlConfig { ... }
				|	
				|	<jc>// A child resource that supports all available marshalling.</jc>
				|	<jk>public class</jk> MyChildResource <jk>extends</jk> BasicRestObject <jk>implements</jk> BasicUniversalConfig { ... }
			</p>
			REST servlets/objects are in the {@link oajr.servlet} package and REST configs are in the {@link oajr.config} package.
		<li>
			<ja>@RestMethod</ja> annotation has been replaced with 
			{@link oaj.http.remote.RemoteGet} / {@link oaj.http.remote.RemotePut} / {@link oaj.http.remote.RemotePost} / {@link oaj.http.remote.RemoteDelete}
			 / {@link oaj.http.remote.RemoteOp}
		<li>
			New shortened form {@link oajr.annotation.RestOp#value()} for specifying http method name and path.
			<p class='bcode'>
				|	<jc>// Normal form</jc>
				|	<ja>@RestOp</ja>(method=<jsf>PUT</jsf>, path=<js>"/{propertyName}"</js>)
				|	
				|	<jc>// Shortened form</jc>
				|	<ja>@RestOp</ja>(<js>"PUT /{propertyName}"</js>)
			</p>
	</ul>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-dto</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			Addition of OpenAPI 3.0 ({@link oaj.dto.openapi3} package).
	</ul>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-rest-server-springboot</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			The requirement for using <c>JuneauRestInitializer</c> during App initialization to use bean injection has been eliminated.
			Instead, root resources should simply extend from {@link oajr.springboot.BasicSpringRestServlet} and {@link oajr.springboot.BasicSpringRestServletGroup}.
			These will automatically hook into the Spring Boot framework for resolution of REST children and various extension beans added
			to the REST API framework.
	</ul>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-rest-client</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			While the general usage pattern stays the same, the REST client code has undergone significant rewriting.  It is now more inline
			as an extension of the Apache HttpClient library.  Much new functionality such as support for fluent assertions has been added.
	</ul>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-rest-mock</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			Entirely rewritten.  Changes too many to list.
	</ul>
