/**
 * Interface for finding classpath resources.
 *
 * <p>
 * Essentially a wrapper around {@link Class#getResourceAsStream(String)}, but with support for looking up resources
 * with localized names (e.g. <js>"myfile_ja_JP.txt"</js>).
 *
 * <p>
 * The following predefined implementations are provided:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>{@link SimpleResourceFinder} - Simple searching of classpath.
 * 	<li>{@link BasicResourceFinder} - Same as above, but looks in local JVM working directory if resource
 * 		can't be found on classpath.
 * 	<li>{@link RecursiveResourceFinder} - Same as above, except if the resource can't be found on the
 * 		classpath relative to the base class, recursively searches up the parent class hierarchy.
 * </ul>
